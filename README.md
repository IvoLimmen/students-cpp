# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build something in C++. I was trained in C++ when I was at school but that was when dino's walked the earth.

## Build

    make

This will create a file called `students` in the bin directory. Run with:

    ./bin/students

## Evaluation

Man this was a trip down memory lane. The language clearly evolved from when I was taught at school. But I could not get this application to work as I wanted it. I needed to dive into making a makefile and read up on how to do stuff in C++ again. I know it has something to do with pointers that I screwed up; just like when I was learning this at school. I guess that working with 4GL's made me forget this. At first I actually did not use pointers and the application did not crash but it did not work as I designed the application to work then I thought it was probably not correct to do it this way and changed the application to use pointers and then everything wend bogus... I do not thing I will program in C++ anytime soon...
